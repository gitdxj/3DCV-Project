### Data

Download the preprocessed LINEMOD dataset (created by the authors of the "Robust 6D Object Pose Estimation by Learning 
RGB-D Features" paper, https://github.com/mentian/object-posenet) from 
[here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19ivHpaKm9dOrr12fzC8IDFczWRPFxho7) and place it in 
the data folder. This dataset contains the original LINEMOD data (Linemod_preprocessed/data) and
the corresponding models (Linemod_preprocessed/models) as well as the segmentations predicted
by a SegNet (Linemod_preprocessed/segnet_results).

The BOP format used is described in more detail 
[here](https://github.com/thodan/bop_toolkit/blob/master/docs/bop_datasets_format.md).
